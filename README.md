# Wordpress deployment with Terraform and AWS
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Terraform to provision and configure an infrastructure stack on AWS to host a WordPress website. The infrastructure stack includes resources such as EC2 instances, security groups, a load balancer, and an RDS database instance. By following this documentation, you will be able to set up a scalable and highly available WordPress environment.

# Prerequisites:
Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An AWS account: You need a valid AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
2. Terraform installed: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the official Terraform website (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. AWS CLI configured: Set up the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your machine and configure it with your AWS account credentials. You can refer to the AWS CLI documentation for detailed instructions on installation and configuration (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
# Step 1: Clone the Terraform Configuration Files
Start by cloning or downloading the Terraform configuration files from the repository where they are stored. Alternatively, you can create the files manually and copy the code provided in this documentation.

# Step 2: Configure Terraform Variables
Open the cloned or downloaded Terraform configuration files in a text editor. Look for the file named main.tf and modify the values as per your requirements. The configuration file already includes default values for most of the variables, but you may want to customize them based on your preferences.

Below are some of the variables you may want to consider:

1. aws_region: Specify the AWS region where you want to deploy your infrastructure. The default value is "eu-central-1".
2. vpc_id: Provide the ID of your existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where you want to deploy the resources. If you don't have an existing VPC, you can create a new one using Terraform.
3. instance_type: Choose the EC2 instance type for your WordPress instances. The default value is "t2.micro".
4. key_name: Specify the name of an existing EC2 key pair to use for SSH access.
5. db_username and db_password: Set the username and password for the WordPress database.

Feel free to review and modify other variables as needed.

# Step 3: Initialize Terraform
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Terraform configuration files are located. Run the following command to initialize Terraform: (terraform init)

This command initializes the working directory, downloads the required provider plugins, and sets up the backend for storing Terraform state.

# Step 4: Preview the Infrastructure Changes
Before applying the changes, it's always a good practice to preview the planned changes to ensure everything looks as expected. Run the following command to generate an execution plan: (terraform plan)

Review the output generated by the command. It provides a summary of the resources that will be created, modified, or destroyed. Ensure that the plan matches your expectations and there are no errors or warnings.

# Step 5: Apply the Infrastructure Changes
If the execution plan looks satisfactory, you can proceed with applying the changes to create the infrastructure resources. Run the following command: (terraform apply)
Terraform will prompt for confirmation before proceeding. Type "yes" and press Enter to confirm. The provisioning process may take several minutes, depending on the number of resources being created.

# Step 6: Verify the Infrastructure

Once the Terraform apply process completes successfully, the infrastructure stack should be provisioned on AWS. You can verify the creation of resources by checking the AWS Management Console or by running Terraform commands.

To verify the WordPress installation, retrieve the ELB DNS name from the Terraform output. Run the following command: (terraform output elb_dns_name)

Copy the output value, paste it into a web browser, and navigate to the URL. You should see the WordPress installation page.

# Step 7: Clean Up (Optional)

If you want to remove the infrastructure stack and delete all the created resources, you can use Terraform to perform a clean-up. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory with the Terraform configuration files, and run the following command: (terraform destroy)

Terraform will prompt for confirmation before proceeding with resource deletion. Type "yes" and press Enter to confirm. The infrastructure resources will be destroyed, and the stack will be removed from AWS.

# Conclusion:
This documentation provided a guide on using Terraform and AWS to create a WordPress environment. By following the steps outlined here, you can easily provision and manage the infrastructure resources required for hosting a scalable and highly available WordPress website. Remember to make any necessary modifications to the Terraform variables and configurations to suit your specific requirements.
